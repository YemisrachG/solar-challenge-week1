# solar-challenge-week1
This project focuses on analyzing solar radiation measurement data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to extract actionable insights for solar energy deployment. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), clean and process the dataset, and develop an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings.


Datasets
The following datasets are used in this project:
•	benin-malanville.csv
•	sierraleone-bumbuna.csv
•	togo-dapaong_qc.csv
Each dataset contains columns such as:
•	GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance (W/m²)
•	DNI: Direct Normal Irradiance (W/m²)
•	DHI: Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (W/m²)
•	Tamb: Ambient Temperature (°C)
•	RH: Relative Humidity (%)
•	WS: Wind Speed (m/s)
•	Precipitation: Precipitation rate (mm/min)
